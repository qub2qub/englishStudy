1 That's good. Could you hold on a second while I get a pen? 
2 Sorry, Bernard, I didn't catch that. Could you slow down a little, please? I need to take some notes. 
3 Let me check that: 200 posters, pens and pencils and 50 bags got it. 
4 Seel-"mayer" ... sorry, could you spell that for me, please, Bernard? I don't think I know the company. 
5 'They've placed an order for 518 of the new lasers please tell you boss Etheo.' 
'Sorry, did you say 580 lasers?' 
6 Sorry, I don't follow you. What does 'roll-out' mean ? 
7 But I need details about the company ... Sorry, it's a bad line. 
Could you speak up, please? I can't hear you very well. 
8 Sorry, I still can't hear you. I'll call you back, maybe the line will be better.
