TALKING ABOUT WEEKEND
I've got really hectic weekend coming up
I think I'll just laze about
I just live for the weekend
Doing anything interesting this weekend?
We're popping out to Paris this weekend. (pop out=выскочить)
Can I crash out on your floor tonight?
I always go to the car boot sale
I just love Sunday morning breakfast
Have a good weekend
I'm going on a picnic in the country with some friends
I usually spend Saturday morning doing the week's washing
I've got to clean the flat up
I think I'll just go and wander around the shops
We're having some people round for dinner tonight
It's not my idea of an exciting weekends
What are you up tonight?
Would you mind watering the plans when I'm gone
Thank God it's Friday = TGIF
