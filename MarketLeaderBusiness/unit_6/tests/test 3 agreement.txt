Starting with strong agreement and ending with strong disagreement:
1) Absolutely.
2) So would I.
3) That's right.
4) Do you think so?
5) Well, actually, I'm not sure I agree with that.
6) I can't go along with that.
7) You must be joking!

1 Shall we go for a drink?
-- Great idea.
2 Would you like to join us for lunch tomorrow?
-- I'd love to, but I've got another engagement.
3 I wondered whether you could come to our housewarming party on Saturday?
-- I'm afraid I can't. I'm going away for the weekend.
4 What about coming round for a drink Friday after work?
-- That would be nice. Thanks.
5 We'd like to invite you to our house after the seminar.
-- I'd be delighted.
6 Do you fancy a bite to eat?
-- Sorry, I can't. No lunch break for me today!

*****************************************************
(1) I think all staff emails should be monitored
-- Absolutely
-- You must be joking! What about our right's stu-privacy

(2) And using the phone at work to make personal calls is so disgraceful
-- I couldn't agree more, while they're chatting important call can't get through
-- Well, actually, I'm not sure I agree with that. My son is ill and alone at home, I simply need to talk to him.

(3) I can't see why we have to stand outside in the cold just because we wanna smoke
-- That's right, Discrimination - that's what I call it
-- I can't go along with that, we simply have to respect the non-smokers, that's all.

(4) I wish there was a decent restaurant or snack-bar near the office
-- Well, LOSARDA is only a ten minute walk, I love it. Their vegetarian dishes are fabulous.
-- Do you think so? The "Boulty Paradise" on the main square is a lot better if you ask me. They do a great buffet (бАффей).

(5) Do you think it would be good to have a coffee machine on each floor? 
-- Well yeah, but people need get some work done as well.
-- I can't agree with that argument. Efficiency is not all about sitting at your desk form 9 to 5, you know. It's also about being happy to be at work. 
-- Hmm.. That's right. Our employees need to interact and to share information in a friendly setting. In a long run good relationships can only benefit the company.
