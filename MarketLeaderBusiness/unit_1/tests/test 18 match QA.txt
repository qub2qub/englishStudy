I can't get through. 
(If you get through to someone, you succeed in contacting them on the telephone.
/Look, I can't get through to this number.
/I've been trying to ring up all day and I couldn't get through. )

It seems we've got a crossed line. (interference on a telephone line that causes more than two callers to be connected)
The line's very faint. (My telephone line is quiet / faint )
Sorry, I didn't understand that.
I'm afraid his line's engaged. (линия занята)


I can't get through. --- Why's that? Still engaged?
It seems we've got a crossed line. --- Yeah. I'll hang up and call you back.
The line's very faint. --- Right. I'll try and speak up a bit.
Sorry, I didn't understand that. --- Well, I'll go over it again, then.
I'm afraid his line's engaged. --- No problem. I'll hold.

a) the person speaks too fast or too quietly 
--Could you slow down a little, please?
--Could you speak up, please?
= slow down / speak up
b) you want someone to stop talking while you do something 
--Could you hold on a second while I get a pen?
=hold on / could I interrupt you 
c) you don't understand a word/expression the other person uses 
--I didn't catch that / Sorry, I don't follow you. / Sorry, did you say .. ?
=what was that = could you repeat = I didn't quite catch it = I didn't quite get it
d) you want to make sure of the spelling of something 
--could you spell that for me, please
=spell it for me
e) you want more information about a subject 
= go over it again
=
f) the connection is not good and you can't continue the conversation 
--bad line / awful line / I'll call you back
= the sound is breaking up = you are cutting out = the sound is distorted
g) you want to confirm some information 
--Let me check that
=Can you just read that back to me
