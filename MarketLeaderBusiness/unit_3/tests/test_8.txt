It is probably true that the most effective presenters have all developed their own special way of captivating their audience. Having said that, they often have a number of common features. Like all good communicators, they are aware that their audience is just as important as what they have to say. Therefore, they try to find out how much their listeners already know about the topic, and about their attitude to it. 
Whenever possible, good presenters also arrive 10 or 15 minutes before their talk is due to start. This gives them plenty of time not only to prepare their notes and check the equipment but also to chat to the participants as they come in. By creating a relaxed atmosphere, they can easily establish rapport with the audience. And good rapport, as many presenters will tell you, is half the battle.
