ZARA ONLINE

Spanish retailer Inditex has only relatively recently given Zara customers the opportunity to buy garments online. The roll-out of Zara's transactional website began(begin) in 2010 in Spain, the UK, Portugal, Italy, Germany and France – six countries that are among the most important of the company's 76 markets. Until then only one of Inditex's eight store brands – housewares retailer Zara Home – had sold (sell) directly to internet users. Asked about the company's late arrival to internet retailing, Pablo Isla, chief executive, said(say): “For us, 2010 was the right time to go online.” Some analysts venture that Mr Isla, who has made(make) Inditex the world's largest apparel retailer by sales since taking the helm in 2005, wanted(want) to concentrate on Asian expansion and cost controls before turning to new sales formats. With its focus on fashion-conscious teenagers and young people, Inditex has used(use) the internet for many years to promote its various lines and is also popular on Facebook, where it has over 4.5m fans. Its smartphone application, which was launched(launch) at the beginning of 2009, has been downloaded(download) by over 2m people. “The internet and the world of social networking are extraordinary channels of communication which fit perfectly with our group's philosophy,” said Mr Isla. Inditex, whose brands also include(include) Massimo Dutti and Pull and Bear, is at the vanguard of computerised ordering and dispatching systems: in each of its 4,700 stores, managers provide(provide) daily updates on sales and taste trends. However, Mr Isla said Zara, its flagship brand, had been waiting(wait) for online demand to build before launching into cyberspace.

A: OK. That's agreed, then. You'll get everything to us by the end of May.
B: Sorry, no. We said we could deliver by the end of JUNE.
A: Right. So the price we agreed is for your deluxe model.
B: No, that's not quite right. £999 is for our STANDARD model, actually.


1A: So you're willing to give us a 12% discount if we buy over 14 vehicles.
B: That's not quite right, I'm afraid. We were talking about 40 vehicles.
2A: Right. If we ask you to change the specifications, you'll reduce the discount by 2%.
B: No, I'm afraid in that case we'd have to reduce it by 4%.
3A: That's agreed, then. If we pay an extra £300, you'll give us a five-year warranty.
B: Sorry, no. That'd be an extra £500, in fact.
4A: So if we pay an extra £300, you'll give us a five-year warranty.
B: I'm afraid we only give a two year warranty for that amount.
5A: Are you saying that if we increase our order to 500, you'll lower your price to £55 per item?
B: Well, no. For orders of that size we could only decrease it to 75.
