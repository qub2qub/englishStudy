STUDY THE LINKERS  IN ITALICS BELOW:
(1) Our manager never shows any understanding if we let the work get on top of us and never encourages us. CONSEQUENTLY, we don't rate him very highly as a manager.
(2) Sales have been going down for over a year, SO a new policy is urgently required.
(3) Many staff were unhappy with the way they were being managed. AS A RESULT, they were sent a questionnaire inviting them to assess their managers.
(4) The different management styles within the team blended really well. THEREFORE, the project was completed to everybody's satisfaction.
(5) AS the project manager was off sick, there was little chance of achieving much that week.
(6) The staff's high morale is DUE TO the manager's empowering style.

Dear Madam or Sir,
Our company is one of the leading suppliers of speciality chemicals to a wide range of industries in Eastern and Central Europe, where we have 12 branches. We therefore employ staff of many different nationalities. With a view to increasing the efficiency of our operations, we wish to send a group of middle managers on executive language courses in the UK. We would like our staff not only to improve their communication skills, but also to further their knowledge of the kind of English needed in management and in the chemical industry. One of our business colleagues has recommended your college as one of the best. Could you please let us have full details of your executive courses, such as term dates, fees and accommodation with host families. Any other relevant details would be appreciated. As we envisage sending 10 to 15 managers a year, we will naturally be looking for competitive offers and a lasting business relationship.
We look forward to your reply.
Yours faithfully,
Fekete Ferenc
