Social networking: Schools struggle to balance openness with control

It is ancient history in Internet terms, but when Facebook was launched in 2004, only college students could join. It opened up to everybody in 2006, and now has more than 400m users, half of whom log in daily.

So along with the world's biggest brands and celebrities, it is no surprise to find that business schools are joining the rush into social media. Universities can use such networks to keep in touch with their alumni, fundraise, attract students or even help them find jobs.

However, for most business schools, the rise of Facebook and its more corporate-minded cousin, LinkedIn, also presents a dilemma. Many have already invested in an internal network for keeping in touch with students and sharing course notes securely. But college IT budgets can't match the resources available to a company dedicated to building such sites and clunky software means many students prefer Facebook to the official intranet.
"It's a very difficult decision." Says Soumitra Dutta, a co-author of Throwing Sheep in the Boardroom, a corporate guide to social networking.
"The natural tendency for most universities is control – they want to own the network.
But the public networks are very popular and have much better functionality. Most schools are still struggling with this decision."


Trying to bridge the gap between public and specialist networks is BusinessBecause.com, a news and social media site for business schools, that recently launched from the UK.

"Schools are good at communicating with their own alumni and students, but it's tough for students to connect with their counterparts at other schools – in the same city, let alone on the other side of the world" says co-founder Kate Jillings. 
"Networks such as Facebook and LinkedIn are too big. Schools and students need to be able to search for what they want easily and feel comfortable about being open within a specialist community."

Less than a year old, Business-Because is already being used by Cass Business School in London and the George Washington School of Business in Washington DC. But Ms Jillings says not every university has responded so well. 
"Considering that these schools are supposed to be at the forefront of business innovation, it's been hard to convince some of their marketing departments of the merits of social media."


Being close to Silicon Valley, that was not so much of a problem for the Haas School of Business at Berkeley. It has created a Facebook fan page to bring together automatically the various Haas groups that are spread across the network. That page now has more than 4,750 fans – out of a total of 30,000 alumni, although that ratio is improving as Facebook attracts more over-35s.

Haas also creates a private Facebook group for MBA students to meet each other virtually before they arrive in California, which is especially useful for international students. The school also operates a private, internal network with 8,000 members.

It seems sociable students and networking alumni will have to remember several logins for some time yet. But whether public or private, using at least one of these sites is 'crucial' for today's MBAs, says Prof Dutta. "They want to keep in contact with their peer group and what better way is there to do it?"
