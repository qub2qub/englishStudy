Move
RV:Rosalia Valdesi.
PW:Good morning, Ms Valdesi. My name's Paul Whitby. I work for an executive recruitment agency.
RV:Oh yes?
PW:I was given your name by Luis Deltell. I believe you know him quite well.
RV:That's right. Yes. And what is it about?
PW:Mr Deltell suggested I call you. He thought you might be interested in a position that's become vacant at GSP Consulting. It's for a senior financial adviser. Would you like to meet to find out a bit more about the post?
RV:Well, thank you very much for contacting me. But to be honest, I don't think there's any point in us meeting. You see, I'm very happy in my current job, and I'm not thinking of going anywhere else.
PW:Sure, I quite understand. Maybe, then, there's someone you could recommend? Someone I could contact and sound out about the job?
RV:Well, let me see…

3 The slow rise in profit figures is due to  our large investments in new machinery.
4 The band's second album didn't do very well, as  their video was banned.
5 The project manager's off sick, so  there's little chance of achieving much this week.
