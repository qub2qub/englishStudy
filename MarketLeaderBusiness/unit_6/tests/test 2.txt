Well, there are two ways of looking at risk. One way of looking at risk is to  divide risks to an organisation between internal risks and external risks. Now, some examples of internal risks include injuries to employees within a factory or, alternatively, a fire in a warehouse, for example. Examples of external risks can include an earthquake or a tsunami affecting a site or, alternatively, a change in exchange-rate mechanism.
Now, I mentioned that there were two ways of looking at risk. The other way of looking at risk is to divide up risk into four categories – hazard, operational risks, financial risks and strategic risks. I will give you some examples of each of those four.
Hazards can include natural events – typhoons, hurricanes, fires, floods and so on and so forth. Operational risks can include risks such as information technology, supply chain and employment risks. Financial risks include the non-availability of reasonably priced credit or a lack of liquidity within an organisation.

1) an organisation's most important long-term aims =strategic objectives
2) used to talk about looking at things from managers' point of view =top down
3) used to talk about looking at things from the point of view of ordinary employees =bottom up
4) a complete range =full spectrum
5) a list of possible risks =risk register
6) actions taken to prevent something from happening =counter-measures
7) legal agreements =contractual arrangements
8) a methodical examination =systematic analysis
