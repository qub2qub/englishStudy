1) They sent us a very long reply with all the details. But to put it in a nutshell,  that's it, we've won the contract!
2) I wish my boss would stop beating about the bush and tell me clearly whether or not I stand a chance of being promoted soon.
3) She expected profit figures and I was going on about sales figures. Once again, we were just talking at cross purposes.
4) Not official yet, but it seems we're going to relocate. Just heard it on the grapevine.

6) This is a very badly written report. I just can't make head or tail of it.
7) I've tried to tell my boss, but it's like talking to a brick wall. No reaction!
