1) I've just got to check in at the hotel. Then I'll call you to make arrangements for the meeting.
2) Have you set up the meeting with their Chief Buyer yet? We need to see him as soon as possible.
3) I get on with my new boss much better. She's great to work for.
4) We'll have to call off the meeting as some people can't come.
5) I'm really sorry I didn't get that order. I feel that I've let you down.
6) A lot of informal meetings go on in our organisation.
7) The project was not on schedule until the new manager took over. He managed to turn it round in four weeks.
8) It's important to build up a good relationship with your clients.
9) I don't like it when people go over my head straight to the boss. It makes me look bad.
10) He wasn't sure if the new job would work out, but it did and he's very happy there.

11) We've just signed the contract and now we're going to have dinner together to cement our new business relationship.
12) We need to restore our reputation after the disastrous publicity last month.
13) Talks with the workers have resumed this morning after the 3-day strike.
14) I've been cultivating relations with the purchasing manager of EXO inc for several months in the hope that he will give us a big order.
15) The strike severely disrupted the flow of orders leaving the factory last week.
16) Poor service seriously undermines our customer relations so we must give all our staff regular training.
17) After the manager lost his temper with his staff, relations soured considerably and now nobody has any respect for him at all.
18) Your actions have jeopardised the whole project. It may have to be closed down now.
19) The open-door policy promotes good communication between all staff members.
20) We've severed all ties with that company. We simply cannot work with them any more.

1Business in Vietnam is improving each quarter.
2Sales in Thailand have decreased recently.
3Darren says the agent in Thailand has been replaced.
4The new agent has already started.
5Liz plans to attend the sales conference in Singapore.

11I heard it on the grapevine you've been promoted.
12 I asked Rudy to say yes or no, but he just beat around the bush.
13 Look, in a nutshell, my trip to Singapore was a huge success.
14 I think you got the wrong end of the stick. I'm not going on holiday, I'm going on a business trip.
15 John just doesn't listen. It's like talking to a brick wall.

Lufthansa pilots cancel strike
Lufthansa pilots have called (16) off strike action planned for next week after new talks were set (17) up with the German airline.
The announcement late on Wednesday averted, or at least put (18) off, a four-day stoppage that could have cost Lufthansa tens of millions of euros.
The union's action had built (19) up the dispute into one of the worst to hit Germany in recent years, adding to a wave of industrial action across the European airline sector, which has also affected British Airways.
In the end, the stoppage ended after 24 hours when the two sides agreed to carry (20) on negotiating. Lufthansa says strike action costs it at least €25m a day.

21We're meeting tomorrow to discuss the new marketing strategy.
22Can we discuss the sales figures? I was expecting an increase, not a decrease.
23We're excited about the launch of the new product range in South America.
24I'd like you to meet Liam. He's the one who organised the successful advertising campaign in London last year.
25We have brand loyalty, we just need to increase our market share.

Dear Kate
You may remember we met at the Memphis Technology Trade Show last spring. I was very impressed with your presentation on your company's successful (26) marketing strategy for one of your clients in Australia.
I'm visiting Philadelphia next week, and I'd like to meet with you if you'll be around. We're preparing for a (27) product launch in a developing (28) market, and I think your firm would be in a good position to help us develop our brand (29) identity.
Our last big product (30) underperformed in this same market, partly because we (31) misjudged the loyalty of the competition's (32) customer base. We don't want to repeat that failure, so we're looking for someone who can run (33) focus groups and be (34) sensitive to market feedback. This person also needs to be articulate(35) enough to communicate a clear brief to the advertising agency.
Let me know if you have time to meet next week.
Best wishes
Gill
