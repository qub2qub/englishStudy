****************************

As you can see from the graph, it has been a  disappointing year for Kanko overall. However, the first quarter was exceptionally good, as sales of our new soft drink N-Ergy rose dramatically. Unfortunately, owing to unexpected production problems, sales fell steadily throughout the second quarter. They then rose sharply until the end of July. The rest of the summer was slightly less successful, and sales did not pick up again until the first half of September. We were then fairly confident that we had the situation under control, but sales just levelled off throughout the next two months.
Subsequent problems at our Norwich subsidiary, however, meant that sales began to drop gradually, and there are no signs of a possible recovery at present. It appears that we had badly misjudged the seriousness of the situation at Norwich, and that we were not fully prepared to handle such a crisis.
