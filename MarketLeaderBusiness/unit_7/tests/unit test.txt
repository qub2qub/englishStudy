STAFF MEMO
As (1) you know, our potential new suppliers from China will be visiting our business next Monday. (2) They will arrive here at 08.30 hours and (3) the Overseas Director, Fred Malkin, who was (4) the one who arranged the meeting, will meet (5) them first in the conference room. There (6) he will welcome them to the company. After that, they will have a tour of the factory with the Production Director, who will discuss the key issues of quality and delivery times. (7) The former is obviously very important because we were let down in (8) this area by our previous supplier even though (9) their delivery times were very good. As (10) these delivery times will become more frequent in future because of the increase in production, the Chinese company needs to be able to guarantee deliveries.

(11) It was very inconsiderate of you not to tell me you were going to be away. Now I have to do all your work as well. (consider)
(12) My boss cannot relax until everything is done to his satisfaction. He's such a perfectionist. (perfect)
(13) I find the new CEO very approachable. He likes people to speak to him about their work and is interested in their ideas. (approach)
(14) My line manager is very demanding. She expects a lot from all of her staff. (demand)
(15) We want to encourage customer loyalty so we're giving them cards which allow them special discounts the more they buy. (loyal)
(16) Your reasons don't make any sense. They're totally illogical. (logic)
(17) They were impressed by the efficiency of our organisation. I think we'll win that contract. (efficient)
(18) Mr Jones has a collaborative management style. (collaborate)
(19) It was very undiplomatically of you to say that about our associates. It could cause a lot of problems. (diplomacy)
(20) Flexibility is important for this position as the job description seems to change weekly. (Flexible)

The purpose of my talk today is to tell you about our new dishwasher which will be launched next month. (21)
What I want to do today is tell you about it in detail and then give you a demonstration of its incredible new features.
Firstly what is its (22)
unique selling point? Well, what distinguishes it from the competition is the speed of the wash. You can have a full hot wash in under 30 minutes. This will definitely give (23) us an edge over the competition whose fastest hot wash is 1 hour. It will therefore (24) undoubtedly appeal to restaurants, hotels and so on, saving them both time and money.
Although this product has many (25)
outstanding features, I'd like to (26) draw your attention to the 10-minute wash for plates. Just imagine how this will cut down time and the amount of crockery businesses will need to buy. And let's not forget the energy savings.
Please (27) take a look at the diagram here which gives you all the technical details.
Now, (28) turning to the cost of this magnificent machine. It is no more expensive than its nearest competitor and once again I'd like to (29) highlight the enormous benefits already mentioned. (30) What this means is that by investing in our product, your businesses could make considerable savings.
