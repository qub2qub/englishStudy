It is true that somewhere between two-thirds and seven-eighths three-quarters of all acquisitions fail, uh, so the success rate in acquisitions is evidently obviously quite low. And the reason for that is due to a number of different causes factors. First off, inadequate planning. Uh, that is to say that the strategic plan behind the acquisition tends not to be anchored grounded in too much of what the future strategy would be, but more of an opportunistic basis as to whether a company is able to be bought acquired or not. 
Secondly, the due diligence done on the target company tends to be carried out done much too quickly, and in many cases doesn't concentrate focus on the key factors that are going to drive that particular deal to success in the future. More time should be spent trying to understand what it is that really makes that target company successful – if it is already successful – or why perhaps it has failed, uh, and whether that can be transformed turned around if, in fact, the company is being acquired because, uh, it is a company that's now available, because of lack of success
