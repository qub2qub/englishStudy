One-word answers often sound unfriendly and sometimes even rude. In order to respond politely or enable the conversation to develop, a follow-up comment is often necessary.

Oh, thanks very much. That's very kind of you.
That's right, yes. Straight down this corridor, last door on your left.
 Yes, of course. Please go ahead.
  Yes, it is, isn't it. How about closing that window?
 I'd really appreciate that. Thank you very much.

Look at these comments made during negotiations. What is wrong with them? Such comments would generally be perceived as too direct, or even downright rude or aggressive. Briefly think of more diplomatic ways of making these comments. Then listen and practise the sample answers.

1 More credit? No way!
2  Give us a discount.
3 Delivery in one week? Pay on delivery, then.
4 Lower our prices more? Sounds like a bad joke.
5 8% discount? OK, but then order over 100. Alright?
6 We want you to alter the specifications.

1 I'm afraid we're not in a position to extend your credit at the moment.
2 Could you give us a discount?
3 If you pay on delivery, we could process your order in a week.
4 I'm sorry, but we cannot possibly consider lowering our price even further.
5 If you order over a hundred, we can give you 8% discount.
6 I was wondering whether you could alter the specifications.

UK companies have failed in the past to prepare their staff in key areas before sending them abroad. What's new is THAT they are starting to PAY attention to it. Previously, the definition of a successful ASSIGNMENT was that the jobholder didn't quit early, but now companies are waking up TO the fact that assignments are not NECESSARILY successful just because the person stays abroad for the allotted period. While 89 per CENT of companies formally ASSESS a candidate's job skills prior to a foreign posting, less THAN half go through the same process for cultural suitability. Even FEWER gauge whether the family will cope.
