bubbling over with excitement
everything is at your disposal
think on one's foot
to be on the ball

******

to put it in a nutshell
to get straight to the point
to hear it on the grapevine
to put someone in the picture
to get the wrong end of the stick
to be on the same wavelength
can't make head nor tail of it/smth
to talk at cross-purposes
to beat about the bush
to get it straight from the horse's mouth
to be like talking to the brick wall
to keep someone in the loop

*****

air your views
be at a loss for words
drop a hint
give somebody the low-down
keep somebody up to date

******
impetuous and emotional
causing offence
get away with weak excuses
a dangerously corrupted medium
to be a terrible distraction
devices being used in meetings I chaired
I have now vowed to switch off smt..
keep in touch with far-flung commercial contacts
discreetly and directly pitching to someone powerful
it certainly beats trying to get a meeting

********
shoot!
it's a paint in the neck
he's always [doing smth] (he's always beating about the bush)
in/at the meeting
a bit .../adj at times (my boss is a bit vague at time)
a bit of a .../noun (she's a bit of a alcoholic)
to find a shoulder to cry on
talk trash
I was kept out of the loop
she lets her steam off
who are you on the same wavelength as?

latest developments = cutting edge = state of the art
do harm = cause offence = to offend
cause confrontations = cause troubles
уволили = fired = dismissed = let smb go = leave a job = resign from a job 
(why where you let go?, why did you leave a job? I was made redundant)
сократили = make smb redundant (I was made redundant)
I agree = I second it = I support = I am agreed = ..agreed
to be in good terms/relationships = get on/along (well) with
find fault with smb (they are always finding fault with me)
THE only [исключиение->I am AN only child]
peers = сверстники = people of the same age
