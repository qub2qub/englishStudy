I can't get through. 
(If you get through to someone, you succeed in contacting them on the telephone.
/Look, I can't get through to this number.
/I've been trying to ring up all day and I couldn't get through. )

It seems we've got a crossed line. (interference on a telephone line that causes more than two callers to be connected)
The line's very faint. (My telephone line is quiet / faint )
Sorry, I didn't understand that.
I'm afraid his line's engaged.

Well, I'll go over it again, then.
Yeah. I'll hang up and call you back.
No problem. I'll hold.
Right. I'll try and speak up a bit.
Why's that? Still engaged?
