The company (1) signed a contract for a joint venture with a Chinese supplier last week. Although our current suppliers (2) have been very reliable over the past three years, now they (3) areunable to meet all our demands. Mr Gonzalez, our new deputy CEO, (4) joined the company two months ago. He (5) was previously Finance Director of ZEE Plastics, where he (6) had worked for 5 years. Currently he (7) is leading the Chinese joint venture team. He (8) speaks fluent Mandarin and (9) spent a year in China 3 years ago. While he (10) wasworking there he made some excellent contacts.

15 We outsold our competitors by 20% last year, making us the market leaders.

19 Their currency has just been devalued, which could cause payment problems for us.
