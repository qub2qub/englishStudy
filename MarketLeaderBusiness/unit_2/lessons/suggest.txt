Suggest - из English Grammar Today
We can use the verb suggest with: 
1) a noun phrase, 
2) a that-clause, 
3) the -ing form of a verb 
4) or a wh-question word (where, what).
 
1) SUGGEST + NOUN PHRASE
We can use a noun phrase as the object of suggest:
/Can you suggest a good restaurant in this part of town?

If we need to mention the person who receives the suggestion, we use a to-construction:
/My teacher suggested an exam I could take at the end of the year. 
(or My teacher suggested an exam to me which I could take at the end of the year.)
!!! Not: My teacher suggested me an exam …

2) SUGGEST + THAT-CLAUSE
When we suggest an action to someone, we can use a that-clause. 
In informal situations, that is often left out:
/I suggest (that) you leave here around four o’clock. The traffic gets very bad from about 4.30 onwards.

When suggest is in the past, we can use SHOULD in the THAT-CLAUSe:
/Her doctor suggested that she should reduce her working hours and take more exercise.

3) SUGGEST + -ING FORM
We can use suggest with the -ing form of a verb when we mention an action BUT DO NOT MENTION THE PERSON who will do it, because it is understood in the context:
/She suggested travelling together for safety, since the area was so dangerous.

4) SUGGEST + WH-QUESTION WORD
We can use suggest with a question word such as where, what, who, how:
/Could you suggest where I might be able to buy a nice sweater for Mark?
/Can anyone suggest how we might attract more people to the next event?

5) TYPICAL ERRORS

We don’t use [suggest + indirect object + to-infinitive] when we suggest an action to someone:
/He suggested that I should apply for a job in a bank or insurance company.
!!! Not: He suggested me to apply …

We don’t use [suggest + to-infinitive]:
/Henry wanted to tell everyone, but Dora suggested waiting until the news had been announced officially.
!!! Not: Dora suggested to wait …
