6 The fact that he introduced so many rules and regulations upon his appointment did not make him very popular with staff.

Example:
1A: The people in Accounts often say they can't work well together.
B: Well, we had a one-week seminar on team building last May. Maybe they should have attended it.
2A: It is a pity Ron and Ken were always trying to settle their own personal disagreements.
B: I agree. I don't think the trainer should have spent so much time on such private matters.
3A: By the end of the seminar some people were still too shy to talk.
B: I noticed that, too. The trainer might have encouraged everyone to express themselves.
4A: I particularly like the fact that we immediately had a clear sense of direction.
B: Yeah. But I thought the overall objective could have been clearer.
5A: One thing I wasn't too pleased about is how the trainer handled the argument about overtime. 
B: Mm. How do you think she should have dealt with that?

5It must have been a tough seminar – the trainer looked completely drained.
the participants were such nice people.
