(1) Her predictions were fairly accurate, although a few were quite wrong.
(2) The goods were slightly damaged when they arrived, but it was nothing serious.
(3) The senior directors were severely criticised for taking the decisions which led to the bank's failure.
(4) The meal with our clients last night was thoroughly enjoyable.
(5) I think your figures are totally unrealistic. It's going to cost a lot more than that to build the new factory.
(6) They were badly hurt when the accident happened.
(7) I have to say that I'm deeply disappointed in your results. I'd expected you to do much better.
(8) The new designer is exceptionally talented and has already won many awards for his work.
(9) I don't think she was fully prepared for the meeting today, as she didn't have any of the relevant statistics.
(10) The presentation was absolutely awful. Half the audience was asleep and the other half just started talking to each other. Nobody listened to the speaker.

(11) We've calculated that the risks are minimal so we're going ahead with the expansion plan.
(12) You can never really eliminate all risks, but you can limit them.
(13) Several people had accidents because of the faulty product. The company will have to pay product liability costs.
(14) Once we have identified any risks which may occur, we will then do everything we can to avoid them.
(15) When we start doing business overseas we're likely to face many unfamiliar risks so we must be careful.
(16) We're taking a tremendous risk investing heavily in expansion in the current economic climate. We could lose everything.
(17) The chances of another ship sinking tomorrow are negligible. It's just not going to happen again for a very long time.
(18) We need to evaluate the pros and cons of this joint venture. Is it really as good as it seems to be?
(19) It's unlikely that there will be another catastrophe such as an earthquake or tsunami in the region for quite a while, so we don't need to worry.
(20) No one could have predicted the events which led to the disaster last year. They were totally unexpected.

A:As you know, today we are looking at ideas to improve job satisfaction.
Okay, Geoff, (21) what did you come up with?
B:Well, I think that the staff would be happier if their pay was increased first.
A:(22) How do you feel about this, Tom?
C:(23) Sorry,Ican'tagreewithGeoff. My staff told me that what they want is more training.
B:Now, (24) hold on, don't you think they'd want more money in their pockets first?
C:(25) I can't go along with that. With better training, they'll earn more in the long run and have more chance of keeping their jobs.
A:(26) What's your view on this, Scott?
D:Well, (27) I agree providing the training is tailored to their specific needs. Otherwise they'll be even more unhappy.
youmorewithagreeIcouldn't
A:(28) I couldn't agree with you more. There's nothing worse than irrelevant training.
C:(29) What about if we asked staff to complete a questionnaire about the kind of training they'd like to have?
A:Okay, (30) I'll just sum up what we've agreed. We'll hand out questionnaires and explain that training will lead to more money in the future.
