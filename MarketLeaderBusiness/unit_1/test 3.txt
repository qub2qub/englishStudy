SAY vs TELL
1) Can you think of situations when it might be better not to tell the truth?
2) How easy or how difficult do you find it to tell other people to do things for you?
3) In meetings, how often do you say what you think?
4) Have you ever told a joke in English?
5) How easy or how difficult is it to tell the difference between the banknotes used in your country?
6) Can you say 'How are you?' in more than three languages?
7) When you were a child, did you use to do as you were told?

1) They sent us a very long reply with all the details. But to put it in a nutshell,  that's it, we've won the contract!
2) I wish my boss would stop beating about the bush and tell me clearly whether or not I stand a chance of being promoted soon.
3) She expected profit figures and I was going on about sales figures. Once again, we were just talking at cross purposes.
4) Not official yet, but it seems we're going to relocate. Just heard it on the grapevine.
5) If you think you can give a good presentation just because you know your subject inside out, well, I'm afraid you've got the wrong end of the stick.
6) This is a very badly written report. I just can't make head or tail of it.
7) I've tried to tell my boss, but it's like talking to a brick wall. No reaction!
========================================
1) I know you couldn't attend the meeting, so here's a summary of the main points just to 
put you in the picture. 
2) Let me come straight to the point: I think your performance is totally unsatisfactory.
3) I want to be kept in the loop. I don't want important decisions to be taken without me.
4) I thought it was a rumour, but today I got it straight from the horse's mouth. Andrew told me he was resigning.
5) Fortunately Sue and I are on the same wavelength so we hardly ever disagree about anything.
