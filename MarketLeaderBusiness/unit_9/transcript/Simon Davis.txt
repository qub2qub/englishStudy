[00:00]In which ways can a business raise finance and what are the advantages of each way?

[00:05]There are probably, I guess, three ways in which I would see business raising finance. Um, first, er, equity, either current shareholders or new shareholders. Er, a business can raise finance by effectively selling shares to its - more shares to its current owners, or shares to new owners. Um, secondly, I would see a business being able to raise er money by borrowing, through debt.

[00:29]Er, and thirdly there's a hybrid, um effectively a combination of the two, um, something that starts out as borrowing that could convert, um, into shares or equity, er, at some stage in the future. Within that there are two markets that a - a business could raise finance in, a private market or the public market.

[00:49]A private market is what it is, it is a private market, private individuals, private relationships, has the advantages of confidentiality and remaining, um, below the radar screen. Um, the public markets, um, selling shares to the public markets has the advantages of having a much deeper pocket. There is a greater source of funding available from the public markets, um, and that's the same for er, for debt as well, so if you're borrowing money, um, the bond markets, the capital markets, tend to have a far greater, um, amount of funds available, so the larger your business is the more public you're likely to want to be in the way in which you raise finance. And then finally um, hybrid finance, er, as an example, convertible bonds.

[01:40]And what are the disadvantages of the different ways of raising finance?

[01:46]For shares, um, equity carries a fairly significant capital cost, um, people who, er, invest in shares expect a return that reflects the risk that they're taking. Um, shareholders obviously carry the full business risk and don't have a right to be repaid their money. Um, they can receive dividends over time, but only after the company has covered its costs and other liabilities, such as interest on the debt.

[02:14]Um, for debt, and the disadvantages are that obviously, um, the interest burden on debt is required to be paid over time. That reduces the amount of cash that a company has that would otherwise be available, er, for it to use for investment purposes. Um, there's also advantages and disadvantages in the public versus private markets. Um, the public markets, um while they give you a broader, um, amount of capital available, um, they don't create that type of private relationship that you would get in the private markets - you could have a dispersed shareholder base. Um, in the public debt markets, you could end up with, er, effectively bondholders of whom you don't know their identity, um,whereas in the private markets you very closely know who your lender is or who your shareholder is. Um, for the private markets the disadvantages are potentially a lack of capital available if you're a significant business.

[03:14]Um, in addition to that, um, private markets will tend, on the equity side, to want a significant return, and some significant change to shareholder control features, um, to the extent that you will lose a certain amount of control over who your executive management is and how that management effectively runs the business.

[03:34]Do you think finance is always a short-term business or can borrowers and lenders develop more long-term relationships?

[03:44]Finance has become somewhat short-term business, to a very great extent, and there are, I think, three or four reasons, um, for that. One, um, is the breadth of opportunity available, um, gives people such a range of investment choice from a funding perspective, that, um, they are almost spoilt in their ability to invest and then sell and reinvest.

[04:10]Um, so the whole attitude has become quite - quite short-termist as from an investing perspective. Um the second is the speed of in - the speed and quality of information. Um, information is key in making investing decisions, and the better the quality of information, the easier it is to make a decision. But the speed with which investment decisions can be made now, is um, incredible compared to only say ten years ago or twenty years ago. But it does give people the opportunity, effectively, to become a short term investor.

[04:42]Um, I think thirdly, er, what has also happened is that the banks have become less relationship-driven from a financing perspective and more relationship-driven from a sales and distribution perspective.

[04:58]So the relationship between a - a lender and its borrower has changed fundamentally at this time, um, and effectively the person who used to be the lender is now distributing finance to a syndicate of other people who are - who are becoming lenders but who are more naturally, um, inclined to be able to buy and sell the investments that they make. Um, so the loans become a more TRADABLE FEATURE, um, and less static, um, creating a short term relationship between the lender and the borrower.

[05:34]Um, and fourthly, I think from an equity perspective, um, it has become so easy, er, to buy and sell shares, that, um, the - the - the churn of shares is so great, um, that people have very short termist nature. They trade off sentiment as much as they do um fundamental value.

[05:56]Um, I think there is still a place for long-term investing and long-term relationships from both an equity perspective and from a lending perspective. Um, it is rare at the moment. I think the one big example is probably Warren Buffet's Fund. Um, his whole structure is different to that of the majority of the financial markets, in that he does not earn, um, his money from, um, effectively taking a portion of the profits. He earns his money by being invested alongside his investors and he runs businesses and asks the people who run his businesses to run them as if they're running them for the - the generations of their family to come, not on a short term basis.
