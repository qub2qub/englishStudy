To create the right marketing , businesses have to meet a number of conditions.
First of all, the product has to have the right features. For example, it must look good and work well. 
Secondly, the price must be right. If you hope to make a good profit, you want consumers to buy in large numbers.
Then, the goods must be in the right place at the right time, so you have to make sure that the goods arrive when and where they are wanted. To this end, accessing the right distribution channels is crucial.
Finally, the target group needs to be made aware of the existence and availability of the product through promotion. So you need to decide where and when you can get across your marketing messages to your target market. 
Besides, you also need to ask yourself how you will reach your audience. For example, you can get your marketing messages across by advertising in the press, on TV, on the Internet or on billboards.
