Herzberg's Theory of Job Satisfaction
Frederick Irving Herzberg (1923â€“2000) was a management professor at the University of Utah, known internationally for his work on helping companies understand how to motivate workers and increase productivity. He is known for his 'Motivation-Hygiene Theory'. According to Herzberg five factors increase job satisfaction and staff motivation to perform:

1  Achievement
i.e. a sense of accomplishment or pride whenever a demanding task is carried out successfully. One way managers can contribute to this is by encouraging employees to set clear, realistic professional goals for themselves.

2  Recognition
i.e. the acknowledgement of an individual's or group's efforts, or contributions. For example, managers can highlight staff efforts and contributions in meetings. They can also give a genuinely positive performance evaluation, and devise a judicious system of perks such as housing allowances or extra holidays.

3  Challenging Work
For work to be satisfying, there must be tasks that are challenging or motivating. Just as each individual prefers some tasks to others, each finds some tasks more challenging than others.

4  Responsibility
When staff feel responsible and accountable for their own work, and when they are somehow involved in the decision-making process, their job satisfaction increases. Managers can gradually increase staff autonomy and decision making as they gain expertise.

5  Growth and Development
Everyone needs to continue to develop personally and professionally on the job. When there are limited opportunities for growth and development, motivation decreases. Employees may commit energy to other aspects of their personal lives, seek other employment, or burn out.
Managers can advocate educational or special training leave for staff, and encourage them to attend training programmes and conferences.
