bublink over with exitement

everything is at your disposal

think on one's foot

to be on the ball
***
to put it in a nutshell

to get straight to the point

to hear it on the grapevine

to put someone in the picture

to get the wrong end of the stick

to be on the same wavelength

can't make head nor tail of it/smth

to talk at cross-purposes

to beat about the bush

to get it straight from the horse's mouth

to be like talking to the brick wall

to keep someone in the loop
*****
air your views
be at a loss for words
drop a hint
give somebody the low-down
keep somebody up to date
