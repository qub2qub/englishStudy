Sources of finance
What do you need to consider when choosing the source of new business finance?
A key consideration is to strike a balance between  and debt to ensure the funding structure suits the business.
The main differences between borrowed money (debt) and equity are that, with debt, bankers request interest payments and capital repayments, and the borrowed money is usually secured on business assets or the personal assets of the shareholders and/or directors. A bank also has the power to place a business into administration or bankruptcy if it defaults on debt interest or repayments or its prospects decline.
In contrast, equity investors take the risk of failure like other shareholders, whilst they will benefit from participation in increasing levels of profits and on the eventual sale of their equity stake.
The overall objective in raising finance for a company is to avoid exposing the business to excessively high borrowings, but without unnecessarily diluting the share capital. This will ensure that the financial risk of the company is kept at an optimal level.

NEWS DIGEST
Kersta said yesterday it had entered into exclusive talks with Lindcom for the sale of Deltelfone.
Kersta acquired Deltelfone earlier in January and said then that it would dispose of the business.
Analysts say a flotation of 49.9 per cent of the business, which was scheduled for April if an agreement could not be reached on a trade sale, would probably have valued Deltelfone at 7–10bn euros. Kersta refused to comment on the size of the bid.
The takeover of Deltelfone by Lindcom would certainly create potential for rationalisation.

One of the largest carmakers is considering permanent reductions in list prices.
The proposal follows a spate of discounting by smaller rivals and the introduction of the government order aimed at opening up the new car market.

Any cut in list prices would almost certainly force copycat action by other companies.
Carmakers have until December to comply with the government order on car pricing.
