Why do so many mergers fail? Many consultants refer to how little time companies spend before a merger in thinking about whether their organisations are compatible. The benefits of mergers are usually couched down in financial terms: cost-savings can be made or the two sides have complementary businesses that will allow them to increase up revenues.
Mergers are about compatibility, which it means agreeing whose values will prevail and who will be the dominant partner. So it is no an accident that managers as well as journalists reach for a marriage metaphors in describing them. Merging their companies are said to 'tie the knot'.
When mergers are called off, the two companies fail to 'make it up the aisle' or their relationship remains very 'unconsummated'. Yet the metaphor fails to convey over the scale of risk companies run when they launch acquisitions or mergers. Even in countries with the high divorce rates, marriages have a better success and rate than mergers.

Dear Mr Lacour,
I would like to confirm what we discussed earlier this morning. Following your successful presentations at previous ALFITEL conferences, we have pleasure in inviting you to our third conference here in Cagliari in October.
The central theme will be 'The Future of Mergers & Acquisitions', and your talk will focus essentially on the benefits of developing an in-house acquisition methodology.
As you will probably draw a sizeable audience as in previous years, we have made some special arrangements.
We are going to put you in our main conference hall, which can seat at least 40 participants, and we are going to allocate you a 45-minute slot (inclusive of 15 minutes' questions and answers).
We would be very grateful if you could confirm your acceptance in writing, and we of course remain at your disposal to discuss further details.
