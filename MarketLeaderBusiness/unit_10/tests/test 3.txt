Demanding customers are certainly not new. What is new is their increasing numbers.
It can be argued that, to a large extent, it is the explosion in the number of people using the Internet which has been a primarily responsible for increased customer frustration. It seems that *if the speed of the Internet, and the number of cell phones, websites, and so on *and have increased customer expectations. And when their expectations are not met, customers become quite demanding.
What do customers *will expect? Customers expect e-mails to be answered in a matter of hours, not *for days. Very often, they expect to be able to find the answers to their questions on *a company websites. Moreover, they *must also expect to be able to talk to a live customer service rep *or when they want to, and generally would like their problems to be resolved *as quickly.
One thing *it is certain: companies that want to survive in the future will have to address these issues quickly.
